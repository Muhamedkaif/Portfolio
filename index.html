        <h3>Skills</h3>

      <p><h4>On the frontend</h4> 
        I’m comfortable working with
        <span class="html">HTML</span>,
        <span class="css">CSS</span>, and 
        <span class="js">JavaScript</span>
        for building clean and responsive user interfaces.
        I’ve recently started learning React, and I’m exploring how to create dynamic components, manage routes, and build single-page applications.

      <h4>On the backend</h4>

        I’m learning to use 
        <span class="node">Node.js</span>
        and Express to handle server-side logic.
        I can connect applications to databases like 
        <span style="color:blue; font-size: 30px;">My</span><span style="color: orangered; font-size: 30px;">SQL</span> and have plans to explore Firebase for real-time data handling.

      <h4>In addition</h4>

       I have basic knowledge of <span style="color: violet; font-size: 30px;">Python</span>, especially for data analysis using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
       I’m familiar with how RESTful APIs work and how to use them in projects.
       I’ve started understanding Git, version control, and tools like VS Code for development.
       Overall, I’m still learning every day, and I’m excited to continue building up my skills through hands-on projects and new challenges.</p>
